# rendaz

"rendaz" is a suite of tools I use to automate my production pipeline
for producing [Ren'Py](https://renpy.org) games and image renders from
[DAZ Studio](https://www.daz3d.com/) (and maybe later Blender).

It should work fine under MacOS (on Intel processors) and Linux, but I
run it in Windows under WSL 2. If you're a Python developer, you can
probably figure out how to set it up. If you're not and you want to use
it yourself, let me know and I will document the setup instructions.
However, I don't anticipate many people will find this useful. It's
written with an audience of one (me) in mind.
